## What is the Virtual DOM?
The Virtual DOM is a virtual representation of the actual DOM (Document Object Model) in memory. React uses this lightweight copy to optimize updates and minimize direct manipulation of the real DOM. By comparing the current Virtual DOM with the updated Virtual DOM, React determines the most efficient way to update the real DOM, reducing the computational cost of rendering.

## Reconciliation Algorithm
Reconciliation is React’s process of ensuring that the Virtual DOM reflects the actual state of the components. React’s diffing algorithm compares the current Virtual DOM with the new one, identifying the differences (or “diffs”) between them. It then updates only the changed parts in the real DOM, rather than re-rendering the entire DOM tree. This algorithm significantly improves performance by minimizing unnecessary updates.

## React Fiber: Concurrent Mode
React Fiber is a complete reimplementation of React’s core algorithm. Concurrent Mode is a feature enabled by React Fiber that allows React to interrupt rendering to work on higher-priority tasks, making applications more responsive. It enables React to pause rendering, perform other tasks, and resume rendering later, ensuring a smoother user experience even when the app is handling multiple complex operations simultaneously.

## Updates and Re-renders: When and Why?
React components update and re-render under certain conditions. Understanding when and why this happens is crucial for optimizing performance. Updates occur when component state or props change. Re-renders can be prevented through techniques like `React.memo` for functional components and `PureComponent` for class components. Proper use of hooks like `useMemo` and `useCallback` can also optimize re-renders by avoiding unnecessary computations and function recreations.
